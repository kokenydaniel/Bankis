## About The Project

### What is Bankist?
Bankist is a fictional online bank. This is a project designed by Jonas Schmedtmann to practice DOM manipulation and user interaction. You have the possibility to log into the account and use several functions, just like in a real bank!

### Functions:
* Login
* Transferring value to another account
* Get a loan
* Closing (deleting) an account.

## login details
It is important that there is no actual registration behind this! Be sure to use usernames in lowercase!
### Account1
* Username: dk
* Password: 1111

### Account2
* Username: jd
* Password: 2222

## Built in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Vanilla Javascript

## What I learned

I learned a lot about DOM manipulation and user interaction. I was able to practice new things for many parts of me, such as login, date and currency management based on location. I really liked the challenges that came up, both in the implementation of responsiveness and connecting the main page and the login page. I found it interesting how the DOM can be manipulated depending on who is logged in.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
